This file contains questions I had while building this project, along with what I tried, and what I learned and useful tips.

- *Flex* is used to make sure that the entire content is vertically and horizontally aligned in the viewport- regardless of the screen size. Therefore, having the contents of the container growing, shrinking accordingly.
  example
  when Nav is a flex container, and logo and ul are the flex items
  I am controlling how these items are to each other.


- Nav ul on becoming a flex container with alignment properties control how the <li> items (children of ul) are to each other.

  
- You want to...
  Align inline text inside a block
